# Neural Network Charity Analysis

## Overview of Project
For this week's project, we will be implementing Neural Networks using the TensorFlow platform in Python. Neural Network is a machine learning technique that is modeled after the neurons in the brain. With Neural Networks, we can combine multiple statistical and machine learning models with little effort. This model helps evaluate all types of input data and produce a decision-making result.

### Purpose
The purpose of this week's project is to design and train a Neural Network model so Alphabet Soup can predict which organizations are worth donating and which are too high risk. Alphabet Soup is a non-profit foundation dedicated to helping organizations that project the environment, improve people's well-being, and unify the world. 

## Results

Data Preprocessing
- What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
- What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
- What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
- What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

## Summary

Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
